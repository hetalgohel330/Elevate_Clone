Project Title: Netflix Clone

I developed a Netflix clone website using HTML5 and CSS3, designed to replicate the look and feel of the original streaming platform. The site features a clean, modern interface with a responsive layout for optimal viewing on any device. It includes a homepage with featured content, a dynamic grid displaying popular movies and TV shows, and hover effects for detailed information. The navigation bar allows easy access to different categories, and a footer provides quick links and contact information. This project showcases my skills in front-end development, focusing on design precision and user experience.
